  Tidied up source code
  Entry point of eraseflash changed, important for Cornerstone

  Small optimisations here and there
  Hexdump utility for cloning now included
  Tidied up disassembler
  - takes about 500 Bytes less
  - doesn't need any global variables now

24.12.2012: Mecrisp 0.9 reaches stable !

09.04.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.9.1:
  New target ! First samples of MSP430G2955 arrived.
  Vectors irq-timerc0 and irq-timerc1 are for additional Timer A3.
  As MSP430G2855 and MSP430G2755 seem to differ only in Flash size,
  hex files for them are included, too, but untested.
  Adjusted jump range check constants for all targets
  in controlstructures.asm to catch too long jumps.
  This happens only to definitions with hundreds of lines, but just to be sure.
  Fresh hex files are included, they are binary compatible
  with older Mecrisp 0.9 releases and their hexdumps.
  Updated English sources

24.06.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.0:
  Finally the first stable release of Mecrisp.
  No bugs have been found, no changes were needed.
  This is simply a cosy compilation to have all the files scattered around
  while going the long way to stable together in one place.

03.07.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.0 Lowpower Experimental:
  Introduced free working register r7 saved solely on IRQ entry which makes core smaller.
  Changed terminal to use ACLK and sleep in LPM3.
  Runs with 32768 Hz ACLK crystal only !
  Included definitions LPM and WAKEUP
  Adapted basis definitions to new clock

26.08.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1:
  Saved more memory and included in core: cr space / ( u*/
  Tab is now accepted as whitespace
  Introduced free working register r7 saved solely on IRQ entry for all targets
  F1612 is now equipped with UART interrupt vectors
  Lot of small optimisations in core

08.09.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1.1:
  Bugfix:  u<=  u>  <=  >

17.09.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1.2:
  Updated English sources, no changes in hex files

07.11.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1.3:
  Just replaced list.txt which had a small flaw by more advanced insight.txt.
  No changes in hex files


22.02.2015, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.0 experimental:

  New targets:

  * MSP430F5529 Launchpad
  * MSP430FR4133 FRAM Launchpad
  * MSP430FR5969 FRAM Launchpad

  So many changes !

  Mecrisp 2.0.0 is inspired by experience with Mecrisp-Stellaris,
  adds many new features, changes string handling to address-length,
  contains everything necessary for multitasking and lowpower.

  This increases core size from 9 kb to 11 kb, but I think it is
  worth it as those new features give much more convenience and fun.

  For better maintainability the source code has been restructured, many
  assembler switches and the German language source tree have been dropped.

  The list of changes would be too long, see glossary for details and
  enjoy many new ready-to-run Forth examples.

  Of course, changing so much might have introduced fresh errors,
  so if you need good stability stay with rock solid 1.1.3 for a while.

13.06.2015, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.1:

  Mecrisp 2.0.0 seems to be quite stable, so 2.0.1 is not experimental anymore.
  Added graphics demo with Bresenham lines and 8x8 bitmap font

  New target:
  * MSP430FR6989 FRAM Launchpad

  Contribution by Glen Worstell:
    An example for a custom prompt and a crystal capacitor tool

23.08.2015, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.2:

  Fixed behaviour of move that had an offset by one when moving forward

27.03.2016, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.3:

  New target: MSP430FR2433 on Chipstick by Ken Boak
  Added ahead and changed control structures to allow more combinations
  No line break directly after the "Redefine..." message anymore

05.08.2016, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.4:

  Contribution by Ronny Suy:
    Port for MSP430FR5994 Launchpad

  Reworked the README with editorial changes and minor updates
  Added rxdma.txt, testeron.txt, testeroff.txt

  moved the example to, and added semaphores to multitask-examples.txt
  Added added 'same?' and 'compare' to ansify.txt
  Added assemblew.bat

09.09.2017, Matthias Koch, skvery, Mecrisp 2.0.6a

  Fixed rxdma.txt

24.08.2018, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.7
